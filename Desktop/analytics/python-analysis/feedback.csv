But the routine helps me anchor and get started, regardless of how I feel that day. 

The micro breaks help with hyperfocus too as a bipolar I also have a tendency to ignore my basic needs due to manic or hypomanic episodes. So the routines and the breaks help me take care of my basic needs so my symptoms don't fluctuate as much. Right now, the app keeps reminding me to take a break, and most times I ignore it LOL. but today, when the notification says I have a few seconds left and I can postpone my break in 5 minutes, my brain knows to stop within 5 minutes and therefore I feel like i have to work faster and meet the deadline. 

I also like that I can save the link of the routines. Although I have not done it at this point, I think as a bipolar it will help in guided meditations, workouts, devotionals, motivational videos, etc. I am planning on adding my favorite youtube links here. 

As I use the app, I'm excited to see how it will enhance my work-life balance. I am thinking of spreading this app to my bipolar community once I become more familiar with the features.
